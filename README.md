Pokédex App 

This is an application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a list of the 151 first generation pokémon. The webpage displays a basic list of the Pokémon names as buttons, and each button will open modal that displays the pokémon's name, height in meters, and an image of the pokémon. Most of the css (i.e. the navbar, the modals, and the buttons) are created using Bootstrap. The information about the pokémon is imported from PokéApi (https://pokeapi.co/).

Features to be Added

These are features that I would like to implement in future, as time allows.  
1. Improved Styling to make the web page more attractive 
2. A search function that will open the modal of the entered pokémon name (possibly with with predicitve text).
3. A button that will open the modal of a random pokémon 
4. Displaying the pokémon as panels that include their image, instead of as a plain list.
